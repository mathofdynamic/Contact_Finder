# üîç Company Contact Finder - Usage Guide

## Overview

The **Company Contact Finder** is an integrated tool that combines CEO/executive search with company website scraping to find comprehensive contact information for any company. This tool fulfills your exact requirements:

1. **CEO Search**: Uses Playwright to search Google for CEO/executive LinkedIn and Twitter profiles
2. **Website Scraping**: Uses Selenium to extract emails, phone numbers, and social media links from the company website
3. **JSON Output**: Provides structured results in JSON format for easy integration

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```bash
python3 company_contact_finder.py
```

By default, it will process `droplinked.com` as an example. To change the target company, edit line 689 in the script:

```python
# Change this line to target any company
company_domain = "your-target-company.com"
```

### What It Finds

**CEO/Executive Data:**
- LinkedIn profiles of CEOs, founders, executives
- Twitter profiles of company leaders
- Names and headlines from profiles
- Direct profile URLs for outreach

**Company Website Data:**
- Email addresses (from mailto links and page text)
- Phone numbers (from tel links and footer sections)
- Social media links (Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, etc.)
- Company logo URL
